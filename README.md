- Combined **Lottie** with **gesture recognizer** to make a slider with animation effect.
- Customized annotations to present image as placemarks, which glowed via **Core Animation** with  several colors when receiving user's queuing reports.
- Created button bar to paging several categories collection view selection via tap or - swipe gesture with animated indicator view.
- Used **Core Data** with the **Singleton** pattern to manage drafts.
